# Perfect Dark Decompilation PC Port

If you want a job doing properly, do it yourself.

We've waited 25 years for a Goldeneye Re-release. A proper HD Remake. Not an emulated mess.

So here's my simple 3-step plan to make this happen;

1) Port this codebase over to the PC. Re-do all of the work that 4J studios did.

2) Port the Goldeneye assets to the Perfect Dark engine. Think GoldeneyeX but finished.

3) £££ or something.
